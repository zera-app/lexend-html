# CKEditor 5 Sample Project

## Setup instructions

### 1. Fill the required information

Make sure to fill in the required information, as the editor requires a license to start. If you don't have an account, you can [create a free account](https://portal.ckeditor.com/checkout?plan=free) to access all premium features for a 14-day trial.

### 2. Run the web server

Run local HTTP server (like `nginx`, `caddy` or `serve`) that will serve the files that you created. It's required, as we are using type="module" in our scripts.

### 3. Start the project

Open `index.html`.

## Integrate with your project

The editor files are in two folders: `ckeditor5` and `ckeditor5-premium-features` (if you use premium features). You need to copy them to your project's assets, and then import with a similar way as the sample `index.html` does.
